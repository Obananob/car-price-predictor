# ðŸš— Car Price Predictor â€“ Linear Regression

This project uses a linear regression model to predict car prices based on features such as brand, year, mileage, fuel type, and transmission. It's a simple but powerful example of applying machine learning to a real-world regression problem.

## ðŸ§  What I Did
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset (handling missing values, encoding categorical data)
- Built a linear regression model using scikit-learn
- Evaluated performance using RÂ² score and RMSE
- Visualized model results and predictions

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## ðŸ“Š Sample Features Used
- Car Brand
- Year of Manufacture
- Transmission Type
- Engine Size
- Mileage
- Fuel Type
